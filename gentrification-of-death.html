    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span>Seven</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;boroughs in London contain no new grave space, and a further 19 will be unable to meet expected demand for burials over the next 20 years, according to local authorities. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The shortage of burial space in the capital is reaching a critical stage in many of its 32 boroughs. Data shows that the majority of them currently lack the capacity to supply enough graves to meet the level of demand suggested by mortality projections over the next two decades. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p
        class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Changes to burial legislation gives London boroughs the authority to reuse graves in order to combat grave shortage. The practice involves placing a new or additional body in an existing grave, and is being touted as the answer to the city’s burial space crisis.</span></p>
        <p
            class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Graves chosen for reuse must be over 75 years old. The cemetery contacts families to ask for consent and public notices are posted on or near the graves six months beforehand. If there is an objection, the grave will remain untouched. &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p
                class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c7">A grave change</span><span class="c2"><br><br>Private burials in London’s Southwark Council may soon be carried out on top of existing public -- paupers’ -- graves to combat the borough’s burial shortage. </span></p>
                <p
                    class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Presently, there are only 180 empty burial plots in Southwark’s three cemeteries, with none remaining in Nunhead Cemetery. <br><br>Sam Rees, Southwark’s bereavement services development manager, said that number will change mid-to-late this year as the Council’s developing new burial space. <br><br>The Council was granted approval in 2017 from the Diocese of Southwark to begin its controversial plans to create burial spaces on the consecrated land, which the diocese presides over. <br><br>Blanche Cameron, chair of Friends of Camberwell Cemeteries, leads a group of local advocates fighting the council over its plans to reuse graves.<br><br>Cameron said: “Most relatives have not been informed. This is because most are buried in 'paupers' or 'common' or 'public' graves, buried up to 20 deep. They have far fewer legal rights than the more expensive individual private graves. <br><br>“Burial records do list who is in which grave, but there is no requirement for the Council to ask the family's permission to dig them up. The Council doesn't even have to get permission from families of the private graves, or even actually find the families. Councils only have to show they tried to find them.”<br><br>However, Council spokesman John Wade, said the local authority does not currently reuse graves but may in the future. <br><br>A similar scheme is already in place in the City of London, Cemetery &amp; Crematorium, where more than 1,500 graves have been reused. </span></p>
                    <p
                        class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c3"><span>The 161-year-old cemetery was on the verge of running out of space when officials decided to begin reusing graves in 2009. </span><span class="c2">It has proven to be a popular choice, with over 60 per cent of burials there now in reused graves. &nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p
                            class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Trevor Davis, Westminster cemeteries manager, believes the most effective way to stop cemeteries from overflowing is by reusing graves. <br><br>He said: “New graves can continue to be developed on an indefinite basis as required through overfill/overvaulting and through reuse.”</span></p>
                            <p
                                class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                                <p class="c3"><span class="c2">To avoid reusing graves, some cemeteries in London have “created” new burial plots. <br><br>A Greater London Authority audit from 2010 reported that Brockley &amp; Ladywell Cemetery in Lewisham “found” space by demolishing chapels and cleaning land that was ornamentally planted. <br><br>Even so, the entire authority of Lewisham will run out of spaces at its four cemeteries in between eight and 10 years, said Council spokeswoman Alison Beck.</span></p>

This can be seen in London, where a burial shortage has forced people to pay more for a grave in boroughs where they do not live. </span></p>

However, I could not find one with an updated -- or accurate -- assessment of exactly how many grave spaces are available in each existing cemetery in London. The Ministry of Justice, responsible for cemeteries in the UK, said there is no national assessment of grave spaces. So, I contacted all 32 boroughs and private cemeteries in London to find out how many empty burial spaces there are in each cemetery. It took me months to find out this information, and not every authority I contacted got back with me or kept records of available burial space. </span></p>
